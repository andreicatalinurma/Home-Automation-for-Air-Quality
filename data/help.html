            3. Window Status displays the state of the window(open/close), the
            value of the sensors, and contains two buttons, one for toggle the
            window (open/close) and one for blocking the window in close position.
            If the window is open and block is triggered, the window will close
            and nothing cannot overide this command.

            4. Sensor Customize allows the user to set base values for the sensors
            as its will. The Base values represent the comparison values for
            the sensors. With them the user can set if the window should be open
            at a specific temperature, humidity or if it is raining.

            5. Reset allows the user to reset the board. After 10 seconds, the
            user will receive a confirmation if he want's to reset the board to
            its initial state. The reset will bring the customize sensor values
            to their default values.
