            This project is a low cost home automation system that controls the
            air quality inside a room by reducing the indoor relative
            humidity to a healthy level and control the temperature .

            The software is designed to open and close a window depending on the
            input from several sensors: temperature, relative humidity, rainfall
            and motion. It also includes two user inputs, one phisically and one
            digital. The inputs allow the user to open and close the window at
            its will. The system also integrates a blocking UI button, which
            blocks the window and close it.

            The web application, allows the user to customize the control of the
            air quality within the room by changing the settings within the
            application.

            First the microcontroller acts like an access point, from where the
            user can choose his wifi network to connect. After the user enters
            his credentials, the microcontroller becomes a server which will
            display to the user the main app.
